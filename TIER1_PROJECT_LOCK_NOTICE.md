# 🔐 TIER-1 PROJECT LOCK NOTICE

## STATUS: CLOSED · LOCKED · FINAL

This notice formally declares the **permanent closure** of the SeekReap **Tier-1 PURE** project.

Tier-1 is no longer active, evolving, or open to modification of any kind.

---

## 1. PROJECT CLOSURE DECLARATION

As of the final freeze commit, **Tier-1 PURE is complete and closed**.

All intended architectural objectives have been satisfied:
- Tier-1 implements Tier-0 invariants only
- Tier-1 contains pure, deterministic, atomic behaviors
- Tier-1 introduces no protocol meaning, governance, or policy
- Tier-1 maintains strict non-authority status

No further work is planned or permitted.

---

## 2. LOCK SCOPE (PROJECT-LEVEL)

This lock applies to the **entire repository**, including:
- All source files
- All documentation
- All audit artifacts
- All placeholders
- All structural conventions

This is a **project-level lock**, not a directory-level or surface-level lock.

---

## 3. CONTRIBUTION STATUS


The following are permanently prohibited:
- Pull requests
- Issues proposing changes
- Refactors, cleanups, or optimizations
- Documentation edits
- Comment expansion or clarification
- Tooling, CI, or automation additions
- Semantic reinterpretation of Tier-0

There are **no exceptions**.

---

## 4. CHANGE POLICY (NONE)

Tier-1 will **not**:
- Evolve alongside Tier-0
- Receive patches or fixes
- Be modernized or refactored
- Be aligned retroactively with future protocol updates

If Tier-0 changes materially, **a new Tier-1 repository must be created**.

This repository remains unchanged as a **historical implementation snapshot**.

---

## 5. AUTHORITY & HIERARCHY

- **Tier-0** remains the sole normative authority
- **Tier-1** is strictly implementational
- Tier-1 defines:
  - No protocol meaning
  - No governance
  - No policy
  - No interpretation

Tier-1 exists to **execute structure, never to decide meaning**.

---

## 6. DOWNSTREAM USAGE

Tier-1 may be:
- Imported
- Referenced
- Audited
- Replaced wholesale

Tier-1 may **not** be modified in place.

Downstream tiers (Tier-2+) must treat this repository as **read-only**.

---

## 7. FINAL STATEMENT

This repository is **architecturally sealed**.

Tier-1 PURE stands as a completed, minimal, non-authoritative execution layer whose sole purpose is to serve as a stable foundation for higher-tier semantic systems.

---

## 🏁 PROJECT CLOSED

**Tier-1 PURE is closed.  
No further action will be taken.**
