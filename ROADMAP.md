## Important Notes
1. **This roadmap is informational only** and not a commitment to specific features or timelines.
2. **Tier 0 is complete and frozen.** No further development occurs in this repository.
3. **Innovation happens in Tier 1+**, which maintains clear separation from this foundation.
4. All tiers build **upon** the frozen Tier 0, never modifying it.

## Boundary Philosophy
> Tier 0 defines **what** verification means.  
> Tier 1+ defines **how** verification is executed.

This separation ensures a **stable foundation** while allowing **operational innovation**.
