# Contributing to Tier 0

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: TIER 0 IS FROZEN
This repository (Tier 0) is **permanently frozen**. It serves as:
1. Canonical documentation foundation
2. Governance boundary definition  
3. Reference implementation examples
4. Frozen specification layer

## What CAN Be Modified (Minimal)
- Typos and grammatical errors
- Broken links
- Administrative metadata updates
- Redirect notices to Tier 1+

## What CANNOT Be Modified
- No substantive content changes
- No new features or functionality
- No breaking changes to structure
- No implementation code changes

## Where to Contribute Instead
All active contributions should go to:
- **Tier 1+ repositories** for implementation
- **Documentation improvements** in relevant tiers
- **Bug fixes** in active codebases

## Pull Request Process (Tier 0)
1. Only administrative PRs accepted
2. Must reference why change is administrative
3. Requires maintainer approval
4. No breaking changes allowed

## Development Process
- Tier 0: Frozen specification (this repo)
- Tier 1: Active implementation
- Tier 2+: Production deployment

---
*Tier 0 defines the rules. Tier 1+ builds the system.*
