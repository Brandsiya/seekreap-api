## 🎯 PURPOSE OF THIS LOCK

This document establishes a **binding architectural contract** that permanently restricts the `SeekReap-Tier-1-PURE` repository to contain **ONLY** pure business logic, algorithms, and core functionality—completely decoupled from all infrastructure, frameworks, deployment, and third‑party dependencies.

[Rest of the locking statement remains the same...]
