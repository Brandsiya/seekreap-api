# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Document**: FAQ.md  
**Version**: 1.8.0 (Immaculate Specification)  
**Status**: 🧊 PERMANENTLY FROZEN  
**Purpose**: Address common questions about Tier 0

## General Questions

### Q: What is Tier 0?
**A**: Tier 0 is the **permanently frozen** specification layer of the SeekReap verification system. It contains only canonical documentation and governance boundaries. All implementation belongs to Tier 1+.

### Q: Why is Tier 0 frozen?
**A**: Tier 0 is frozen to:
- Establish a stable foundation for implementation
- Create clear governance boundaries
- Prevent scope creep in the specification
- Allow innovation to happen in Tier 1+

### Q: Can I modify Tier 0?
**A**: No. Tier 0 is permanently frozen. You can:
- Study the specifications
- Implement in Tier 1+
- Report administrative issues (broken links, typos)
- Request clarifications through GitHub issues

## Implementation Questions

### Q: How do I implement based on Tier 0?
**A**: The CLI specification defines interface requirements for Tier 1+ implementations. Study the specifications in Tier 0, then implement them in your own Tier 1+ repository using any technology stack you prefer.

### Q: What technology should I use for Tier 1+?
**A**: Tier 0 does not specify implementation technologies. You can use:
- Any programming language
- Any framework or library
- Any build system
- Any testing methodology

### Q: How do I verify my implementation is compliant?
**A**: Your Tier 1+ implementation should:
- Follow all interface specifications
- Match all behavior requirements
- Provide all required functionality
- Respect Tier 0 governance boundaries

## Governance Questions

### Q: How do tiers relate to each other?
**A**: 
- **Tier 0**: Frozen specification (WHAT)
- **Tier 1+**: Active implementation (HOW)
- Clear boundary: Tier 0 defines, Tier 1+ builds

### Q: What can I contribute to Tier 0?
**A**: Only administrative changes:
- Typo corrections
- Broken link fixes
- Formatting improvements
- No substantive changes allowed

### Q: Where do feature requests go?
**A**: All feature requests, enhancements, and new functionality belong to **Tier 1+**. Tier 0 is complete and frozen.

## Technical Questions

### Q: What does the CLI specification include?
**A**: The CLI specification defines:
- Interface patterns and syntax
- Command requirements
- Error handling standards
- Output format expectations
- Compliance requirements

### Q: Are there example implementations?
**A**: The `/examples/` directory contains specification patterns that demonstrate **WHAT** should be implemented, not **HOW** to implement it. These are abstract patterns, not concrete code.

### Q: How do I handle versioning?
**A**: Tier 1+ implementations should:
- Use semantic versioning
- Clearly state which Tier 0 version they implement
- Document any extensions or modifications

## Legal Questions

### Q: What license does Tier 0 use?
**A**: Tier 0 uses a custom "Frozen Foundation License" that:
- Allows reference and study
- Permits implementation in Tier 1+
- Prohibits modification of Tier 0
- Requires attribution

### Q: Can I use Tier 0 commercially?
**A**: Yes, you can implement Tier 0 specifications in commercial Tier 1+ products. Tier 0 itself remains source-available and frozen.

### Q: How do I attribute Tier 0?
**A**: In your Tier 1+ implementation, include attribution stating that your implementation is based on the SeekReap Tier 0 specification.
